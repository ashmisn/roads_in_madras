🚀 Running Query: What are the placement rules for a 'Gap in Median' sign on a 90 km/h road, and how do these differ from a 'Narrow Bridge' sign at the same speed?
==================================================

--- Agent Answer ---
Based on your query regarding "Gap in Median" and "Narrow Bridge" sign placement rules at 90 km/h, here are the findings from the database:

**Regarding Gap in Median Sign Placement Rules for a 90 km/h Road:**
* **Finding:** For a speed of 81-120 km/h (which includes 90 km/h), a Gap in Median sign should be placed with a clear visibility distance as 90 m, and it should be at least 180-245m from the hazard.
* **Source:** IRC:67-2022, Clause: 15.26

**Regarding Narrow Bridge Sign Placement Rules for a 90 km/h Road:**
* **Finding:** For a speed of 81-120 km/h (which includes 90 km/h), a Narrow Bridge Ahead sign should be placed with a clear visibility distance as 90 m, and it should be at least 180-245m from the hazard.
* **Source:** IRC:67-2022, Clause: 15.2

Both signs have different placement rules for the same speed range (81-120 km/h), but they provide similar ranges for clear visibility distance (90 m) and minimum placement distances from the hazard (180-245m).

==================================================
🚀 Running Query: What is the 'clear visibility distance' for a 'U-Turn Prohibited Sign'?
==================================================

--- Agent Answer ---
Based on your query regarding 'clear visibility distance' for a 'U-Turn Prohibited Sign', here are the findings from the database:

**Regarding: Clear Visibility Distance and Conditions**
* **Finding:** The clear visibility distance is determined by ensuring drivers have an unobstructed view of road signs to ensure safe navigation. This distance increases as traffic speeds rise.
*   Since the query does not specify a speed, we can consider the general principle stated in multiple documents (S.Nos. 10 and 6) regarding how clear visibility distance is determined.

However, for more specific information about sign placement distances based on design speed, we look at S. No. 7.
*   The 'U-Turn Prohibited' sign should be placed at the start and at intervals along road sections where this restriction is enforced by the controlling authority. The maximum spacing between two successive signs should not exceed 120 meters on each side of the road.

Given that specific information about clear visibility distance for a U-turn prohibited sign isn't provided in the documents, we refer back to general principles mentioned earlier and S. No. 25 for guidance on minimum preview distances related to speed from road markings:
*   For <30 km/h: 17 m
*   30–40 km/h: 22 m
*   50–65 km/h: 36 m
*   70–80 km/h: 44 m
*   90–100 km/h: 56 m

Since the query asks for 'clear visibility distance' specifically in relation to a U-Turn Prohibited Sign without specifying a speed, we cannot directly apply these values. However, understanding that clear visibility distances are influenced by traffic speeds and based on general information about road signs and markings:

**Regarding Specific Clear Visibility Distance for U-Turn Prohibited Signs at Different Speeds**
*   **Finding:** Unfortunately, direct information regarding the 'clear visibility distance' specifically for a U-turn prohibited sign under different speeds is not provided in the given database context. The closest related information is on general principles of clear visibility and distances from other road signs and markings.

🚀 Running Query: There is an object hazard on the left side of my road, but it's on a sharp curve with a speed of 90 km/h. What signs and markings are needed, and what are their placement distances?
==================================================

--- Agent Answer ---
Based on your query about the signs and markings needed for an object hazard on a left curve at a speed of 90 km/h, here are the findings from the database:

**Regarding: Signs and Markings Needed for Object Hazard on Left Curve**

Since there is an object hazard on the left side of the road on a sharp curve with a speed of 90 km/h, we need to consider signs that address both the object hazard and the curve. 

* **Object Hazard (Left) Sign:** 
  * Finding: A vertical rectangle of 300 mm x 900 mm.
  * Source: IRC:67-2022, Clause: 15.66

Since 90 km/h falls between the speed ranges for different sign sizes, we need to identify which size is applicable.

*   **Object Hazard (Left) Sign Size Based on Speed:** 
    * Finding: The exact size for 90 km/h cannot be directly found in the provided database context as it does not explicitly mention this speed range. However, it suggests that signs are needed for speeds below and above certain thresholds but not specifically at 90 km/h.

However, we can still refer to general guidance on sign placement:

*   **Placement of Object Hazard Marker (OHM):** 
    * Finding: The inner edge of the OHM shall align with the obstruction's inner edge wherever possible.
    * Source: IRC:67-2022, Clause: 15.66
    * Note that there is no specific information on distances in the provided database context for placing these signs at this speed.

Given the missing direct correlation between the speed and sign size within the database context, and considering standard practices in similar situations:

**Regarding: Object Hazard Marker Placement Distance**

Since we can't find a direct reference to 90 km/h, but refer to general guidelines that suggest varying placement distances based on approach speeds:

*   **Placement Distance for Narrow Bridge Ahead Sign (Used as Guidance):**
    * Finding: The clear visibility distance and its corresponding placement range vary with the approach speed, typically suggesting at least two signs in view until the change in alignment eliminates the need for the sign.
        - For speeds up to 50 km/h: placed 45m from the hazard
        - For speeds between 51-65 km/h: placed 45-110m from the hazard
        - For speeds of 66-80 km/h, 81-120 km/h, and 121-150 km/h: respective distances are 70 m (110-180m), 90 m (180-245m), and 110 m (245-305m) from the hazard.
    * Source: IRC:67-2022, Clause: 15.26
    * Note that these placement guidelines are for a Narrow Bridge Ahead sign but are often considered in similar situations as a guideline for other signs.

For sharp curves with hazards on the left side, considering typical placement and alignment practices, the signs should be installed far enough to give drivers sufficient time to react to the change in alignment:

*   **Curve Sign Placement Distance:**
    * Finding: The road user always has at least two signs in view until the change in alignment eliminates the need for the sign.
        - It is advised to space chevron signs such that at least two signs are visible to drivers as they approach the curve.
    * Source: IRC:67-2022, Clause: 15.26
